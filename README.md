# AI_Builder_project
I am conceiving of a simple project that maps a candidate CV (data scientist) to see how it compares to data science positions out there in the market. For now, the basis of comparison that I can think of is in terms of skills.

For a start, I be developing some pipeline scripts to extract job postings *(from mycareersfuture.gov.sg)* and extract relevant skills from knowledge using Mike Zhang's knowledge + skill [extractor](https://huggingface.co/jjzha).
